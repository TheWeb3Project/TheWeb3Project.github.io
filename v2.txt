announce people with this asap to make it done quick.
draft plan. could be changed.

in few day, v1 rebase will be disabled
before v2 presale start, v1 trade will be disabled
after v2 launch, rebase will turn on

v1 supply = 289,000
cur liquidity = 4,100 TWEP / 1,300 BNB
cur price = 0.317 BNB ($73.5)
to make clean number,
add 11,000 and make x10000 split

Total supply = 3,000,000,000 (3B) (100%)
Locked = 2,100,000,000 (2.1B) (70%) = company ownership, future use, vested 
Reserved = 300,000,000 (300M) (10%) = for presale
Migration = 300,000,000 (300M) (10%) = locked until v2 launch
Burned = 270,000,000 (270M) (9%) = burn more if reserve left more
presale = 30,000,000 (30M) (1%) = 0.01% for pink fee



migration
all users will manually claim for v2
1 TWEP = 10,000 WEB3v2
due to wweb3 and many things, this is safe and fair for all

pinksale fair launch, liq 100%
target raise 500 BNB, pink fee 2% bnb = 10 BNB
target liquidity = 490 BNB
target token liq = 15,000,000 pink fee 2% token = 300,000
token for presalers = 15,000,000
new price = 0.326 BNB / 10000 ($0.0735+)
total token amount = 30,000,000

if raised x1/5, lower price. give x50000, can give max x80000
if raised x5, higher price. give x2000

tokenomics
4% liquidity (by using 4% token, it is 8%)
4% twt
1% wtf = miner/xweb
1% burn = burn by buyback for certik audit]. it will be changed later
