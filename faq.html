              Dual Rebase
              We have amount rebase and price rebase
              rebase happens every 3 seconds (each block)


              amount rebase
              total supply increases and each user balance increases according to this
              0.1 TWEP increased every 3 seconds, 2880 TWEP daily.
              This will decrease to 1440 TWEP throughout the time.
              5/11 = 1728
              

              price rebase
              price increases so chart will go upward
              this means a shift for current situation
              roughly 7% price increase daily
              (roughly 1.2% for price decrease compensation of amount rebase)
              if price drops 10% in normal situation, we have 3% drop instead
              if price rises 10% in normal situation, we have 13% rise instead


              Tax
              Buy Tax: 14% (if circuit breaker, 10%)
              Sell Tax: 16% (if circuit breaker, 25%)
              More tax added based on your price impact
              If 0.1% price impact, 1.4% more sell tax
              Tax will be capped to 30%


              Slippage
              slippage is just a allowing % to get less
              even if 80% slippage and roughly 3% tax,
              roughly 97% given back to you. not 20%.

              Use swap in our site to ignore this
              Or use poocoin trade for auto slippage
              here is recommended tax/slippage value
              use slippage above that just in case
              12/14/16/18/20/21/23/25/27/28/30
              14/17/19/22/25/28/31/34/37/40/43


              Hall of Fame NFT (upgrading)
              Lock min 1wWEB3 for 360 days to get it
              less than 10wWEB3 get tier 1
              less than 100wWEB3 get tier 2
              100 or more wWEB3 get tier 3

              miner

              use pweb3 / busd / bnb to hire miners
              miners will produce wusd
              wusd is used to rehire miners
              wusd is used also when you hire miners with pweb3/busd/bnb
              you can claim wusd
              
              think of bitcoin mining.
              if there is more miners,
              they will compete more for current resource,
              if you do no action or claim wusd,
              means you still use same amount of miners,
              your mining amount will be lowered.
              you need to rehire miners to maintain or increase mining amount.
              
              daily reward is 6.9%
              this is approx value and depend on other people strategy.
              it may be more or less.
              also gets affected with market situation
              and this is based on the amount you have invested with pweb / busd / bnb
              wusd used to rehire doesnt count.
              regarding roughly 1749 pweb = 1$,
              pweb invest will have 1/5 less reward than busd / bnb 

              no action makes % go down

              claim wusd makes % go down
              for ex, first day you claim 6.9% wusd,
              second day you claim roughly 4.5% wusd,
              third day you claim roughly 2.2% wusd, and so on.

              rehire makes % go up
              so you need to do rehire to make % stable
              to maintain near 6.9%,
              try to hire more for 6 days and claim wusd at 7th day.
              
              frequent rehire means better maintaining reward %
              but 1-3 per day is enough
              
              anti-whale is applied so big invests will get less %
              
              if people invest too much or too less, will get less %
              

              there is 3% fee for hire / claim

              after 4 days of doing nothing,
              miners will stop mining.
              so you should hire more or claim wusd in every 14 days.

              hire more only if there is more than 1.1 wusd
              we will provide more accurate minimum value for this soon

              wusd

              our stable coin pegged with 1 wusd = 1 busd
